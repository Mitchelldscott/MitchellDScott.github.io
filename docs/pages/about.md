# **About Me**

I grew up in San Diego CA and am now almost finished getting a BA in computer science from the University of Colorado at Boulder. I am currently a member of the **H**uman **I**nteraction and **RO**botics (HIRO) research group at CU and have focused my studies on robotics, algorithms, data science, operating systems and numerical computation. After graduation I plan to pursue a master degree in robotic systems and controls through CU's mechanical engineering department. My dream job is developing intelligent and interactive mechatronic/robotic systems. Some of my hobbies include snowboarding, pickup sports, cooking and traveling.
