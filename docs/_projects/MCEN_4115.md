# MCEN 4115 Final Project
This project was based on autonomous mechatronic and robotic fundamentals. The problems we had to solve were navigating the maze, identifying targets and firing a projectile at the targets. The targeting system utilized a Luxonis stereo camera to recursively center the firing mechanism when a target was identified. The navigation utilized a CNN that classiied the section of maze immediately in front of the bot. The final report of the project can be found here.
